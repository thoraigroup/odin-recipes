        Make the meat sauce.

        How to Layer Lasagna
        The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow:
        
        
        Meat sauce
        Noodles
        Ricotta mixture
        Mozzarella slices
        Meat sauce
        Parmesan cheese
        Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.
        How Long to Cook Lasagna
        The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.

        How to Reheat Lasagna
        You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.
        
        How to Freeze Lasagna
        If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.
        
        How to Reheat Frozen Lasagna
        Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through.
